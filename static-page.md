Shopify stores come with a page creation tool, which you can use to generate pages containing information that rarely changes, and that customers will use often, such as an **About page **or a **Contact page**.

You can add as many pages as you like to your store under Online store&gt;Pages, and configure where they appear under

**Online store &gt; Menus.**

Some of these pages come with additional customization options in the form of sections, which will appear under Sections when you navigate to them in your store.

We'll cover the settings for these below.

* **Create a new page**

From your Shopify admin, navigate to Online store &gt; Pages. Click the Add page button to open a new page template.

From here, you can enter the Title and Content in the space provided, as well as set the Visibility and select a Page template. You'll notice that Launch comes with four templates: a general page template, a page.contact template, a page.faq template and a page.faq template. We'll cover the unique features of each of the following sections.

* #### Contact Page
* Step 1: Input title and select Template suffix are page.contact-us, not input the content.

* Step 2: Go to Customize Theme &gt; General settings &gt; Contact Page to set up the content.
