When you install automatically with the Arena Installation Apps, most of the Sections and  General Settings as well as the Products and other components we have included, you just need to adjust the parameters to use the same as the sample demo store. Clicking on any of these "sections" blocks will bring up a set of unique configuration settings, or you can click add a section, which will reveal an array of other optional sections that you can add to your homepage. We'll cover each of them in detail - more or less in the order they appear below.

### **Fixed Homepage Block**

Fixed blocks are exactly what you’d guess they are—components that are fixed to certain areas of your site and cannot be moved. In our theme, there are two fixed homepage block: **Top Bar, Header,  Service Block, Footer.**

**To Config Topbar, Header & Footer please go to Themes -&gt; Customize Theme -&gt; Theme Settings**![](/assets/theme-setting.png)![](/assets/fixed block.png)

#### **Header**

The header is the rectangular area that runs across the top of your store containing your **logo, navigation, best deal block**, **store location block, and cart, search**. It appears on every page and is intended to be used to promote your company's brand and make it instantly recognizable to your visitors. This is a static block and cannot be repositioned. **We support 4 styles of header.**

To Config Topbar go to **Theme Settings --&gt; Header**

#### **Footer**

Like a footer on a document or report, a website footer contains the information listed at the bottom of a page. Typically, the footer is the area that visitors expect to find the "fine print"—legal information such as terms and conditions and privacy policies, but also FAQs, size guides, and contact information. Our theme provides the space to display all of these and more.
