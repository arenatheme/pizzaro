Your products and collection pages are the lifeblood of your e-commerce store. They're where you display your products, convey their value, and, if you're lucky, make the sale.

You'll upload and configure your products and collections in the Shopify admin \(you can read more about that here\), but when it comes to customizing how they display, you'll do that within the theme editor. Just navigate to the page in the theme editor and you'll see a section pop up, giving you access to settings specific to that page.

We'll give you the rundown of the settings for each page below

1. Define your groups. In the image above, the groups are Brand, Focal Length, and Resolution.
2. [Export all your products into a .csv file.](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/import-export/export-products)
3. Prepend all existing tags with the name of the group you want them to be in, with the format
   **Group\_Tag Name**
   . For this example, some of the tags would be
   **Brand\_Canon**
   ,
   **Focal Length\_18 - 55mm**
   , and
   **Resolution\_12 MP.**
   The left side of the underscore is the group name, and the right side is the tag for the product. Spaces can be included on either side of the underscore.
4. Save your .csv. file and import the products back into your store. Make sure you check Overwrite existing products that have the same handle when uploading the file to prevent duplicate products from being created.
