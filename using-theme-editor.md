# Using the theme editor

Once you've uploaded your theme, it's time to make it your own. While all of your products, collections, pages, and navigation will be configured in the Shopify admin, any changes you make to the look and feel of your store will happen in the theme editor. You'll access it by navigating to **Online Store&gt;Themes** and then clicking the blue** Customize **theme button in the top right of your screen.![](/assets/pizzaro-custom=theme.png)You'll see that the theme editor is divided into two tabs: **Sections** and **General settings**. We'll cover each in detail below, but here's the Coles Notes to help you get your bearings.

### Sections tab

Sections are customizable parts of your theme. They let you add, reorder, and remove chunks of content on your store's homepage.

Each theme has a unique set of sections to choose from. Sections let you pick the types and order of content you want to feature on your homepage.![](/assets/pizzaro-theme-section.png)

### General settings tab

The General settings tab lets you make global changes to the look of your store, including typography, color and styles, cart, header, footer, mega navigation collection, product, blog layout as well as other extensions function.
