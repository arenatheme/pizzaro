* **Wide**: The full-width layout is the default layout for the theme and it displays your content centered of course but with a white background through-out. This layout doesnâ€™t have any padding around the main wrapper.
* **Box: **The boxed layout has a padding around the main wrapper as well as a background applied to it so that you can apply a custom background to your body and all your content will be centered with the background flowing around it.
