### Blog & Article Setting

Your Shopify store comes with a powerful built-in blogging engine. Blogs are great for content that you’ll be updating regularly. While many stores maintain only one blog \(probably called "News" or "Journal"\) some create multiple to better categorize information including customer stories, tips, tutorials, FAQs and more. You can set up one \(or multiple\) blogs in your Shopify admin \( Online store&gt;Blog posts\). For more information on getting your blog\(s\) up and running, see their instructions.

We'll give you the rundown of the settings for blog page below

To set the layout of your product pages go to **Theme Editor &gt; Theme Settings.**
